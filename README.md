Game i made for the Game Makers Toolkit Jam 2022.



Idea:
  Moving turret that shoots bullets at a fixed interval (1 second).

  Every time the turret shoots it shoots anywhere from 1 to 6 bullets randomly

  Enemies come down. You need to hit the enemies to kill them

  If an enemy touches the turret you lose
